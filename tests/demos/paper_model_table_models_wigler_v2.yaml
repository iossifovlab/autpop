threshold_model:
  name: "Example 1: Strong rare positive risk"
  male_threshold: 9
  female_threshold: 11
  loci:
    - {w: 1, f: 0.05, n: 40}
    - {w: 8, f: 0.01, n: 2}
  notes: >
    This  model illustrates a rare risk allele
    strong with respect to thresholds. 
    Leads to matching the measured parameters except that the mother is 
    the more shared parent.

threshold_model:
  name: "Example 2: Uniform rare positive risk"
  male_threshold: 8
  female_threshold: 9
  loci:
    - {w: 1, f: 0.05, n: 40}
  notes: >
    This shows that in the absence of a strong risk allele, 
    rare weak allels cause the share of the father approaches 
    the share of the mother.

threshold_model:
  name: "Example 3: Protective variant"
  male_threshold: 18
  female_threshold: 22
  loci:
    - {w: 1, f: 0.025, n: 160}
    - {w: 2, f: 0.025, n: 80}
    - {w: -10, f: 0.01, n: 150}
  notes: >
    This model illustrates that a protective allele 
    can lead to more sharing of the father.
    To make it work we need some "subthreshold noise."

threshold_model:
  name: "Example 4: Homozygous effect on sharing"
  male_threshold: 1.2
  female_threshold: 2
  loci:
    - {w: 1, f: 0.125, n: 1}
    - {w: 0.01, f: 0.1, n: 3}
    - {w: -0.01, f: 0.1, n: 3}
  notes: >
    This model illustrates that tolerance of a homozygous state
    but only (better) in the mothers 
    leads to increased sharing in the father.
    
    To give females some risk, we added low level wobble
    bringing them autism,
    without affecting otherwise the risk to boys.
    This makes the example slightly convoluted.

threshold_model:
  name: "Example 5: Complex frequent risk with protection"
  male_threshold: 10.7
  female_threshold: 11.25
  loci:
    - {w: 0.15, f: 0.9, n: 40}
    - {w: -15, f: 0.03, n: 60}
  notes: >
    This illustrates a complex configuration
    with protective alleles and risk alleles that are tolerated better 
    in the mothers than the fathers.
    Produces high father to mother sharing ratio.
